## Brief Overview of the Research and use of Scientific Computing

My research is focused on mapping the spatio-temporal distribution of iceberg production and iceberg-sourced meltwater fluxes and querying those data to identify first-order controls on iceberg melting relative to other Greenland ice sheet freshwater sources.

For the research, I am focusing on the source of these freshwater sources i.e. Glaciers. We lack understanding on the precise timing of the iceberg discharge as it deviates from flux estimates due to the stochastic nature of iceberg calving. The above figure depict the principle that I would be using to get the estimates in terminus ablation using both discharge values and near terminus mass change incorporating terminus changes. 


As the entire ice sheet has many glaciers, the data I would be dealing with would be abundant as well. Scientific computing can help me in better management and organization of these data. Also there would be a number of same variables for different glaciers, so combining and disintegrating them would be easier using bash.


Also I have found some websites that can help me access great amount of data without having me to download eavh individual file. I plan to run the codes using jupyter as they have pre-written codes for accessing the data using jupyter notebook. 


Overall, it would be a nice course to start my transition to python, as I have been planning to do that for a while.
